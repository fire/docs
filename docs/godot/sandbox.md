# Sandbox

In order to run your code in isolation, you need to create a **Sandbox** node first. 

## Create a Sandbox Node in a new Scene

Create a new **Scene**. The Root Node can be anything, even a **Node**. Next click **Add Child Node** and add a node of type **Sandbox**:

![node](/img/sandbox/node.png)

Then, attach an **ELFScript** to the **Program** property.

![program](/img/sandbox/program.png)

Now, when running the scene, you should see printed on the console:

```
Hello World
```

## Calling functions inside the Sandbox

Next, create a GDScript on the **Sandbox** node in order to call functions inside the sandbox. Inside the script add the following:

```js
extends Sandbox

func _ready() -> void:
	var program_elf = program as ELF_src
	program_elf.test_function()

```

:::note

Here we are casting our program, which is a **ELFScript** to the specific binary interpreted by the sandbox. In our case, the `.elf` binary is located inside the `src/` folder, so the autogenerated name will be **ELF_src**.

With that cast, we have autocomplete support inside GDScript.
