# About this library

*libriscv* is a simple, slim and complete **sandbox** that is highly embeddable and configurable. It is a specialty emulator that specializes in low-latency, low-footprint emulation.

- It's **fast**. Where other solutions routinely require ~50-150ns to call a VM function and return, *libriscv* requires 2ns.
- It has specialized APIs that make **passing data in and out** of the sandbox safe and low-latency.
- It runs on **all platforms** without requiring the sandbox code to be recompiled.
- It has bindings for the **Godot Game Engine**
